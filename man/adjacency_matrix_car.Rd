\title{Adjacency Matrix for Conditional Autoregressive (CAR)}
\format{
A 5Ã—5 numeric matrix with row and column names \code{"1"} to \code{"5"}.
}
\source{
Simulated example created for illustrating spatial structure in CAR models.

\usage{
adjacency_matrix_car
}
\description{
The \code{adjacency_matrix_car} contains a symmetric adjacency matrix used for demonstrating
\emph{Hierarchical Bayesian Small Area Estimation} (HB SAE) with spatial structure under the
Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model.
The matrix consists of 0s and 1s to represent neighborhood relationships between areas,
where a value of 1 indicates direct adjacency. This structure is commonly used in CAR models
to specify spatial dependence based on local neighborhood connections.
