A 100Ã—100 numeric matrix.

\source{
Simulated example created for illustrating spatial structure in SAR models.

\description{
The \code{spatial_weight_sar} dataset contains a standardized spatial weight matrix designed
for use in \emph{Hierarchical Bayesian Small Area Estimation} (HB SAE) under the
Simultaneous Autoregressive (SAR) model.
The matrix represents spatial influence between areas with continuous, non-negative weights,
and is symmetric with zeros on the diagonal.
This structure allows modeling of spatial autocorrelation with varying intensity across regions.
