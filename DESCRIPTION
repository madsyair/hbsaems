Description: Implementing Hierarchical Bayesian Small Area Estimation 
    models using the 'brms' package as the computational backend. The 
    modeling framework follows the methodological foundations described in area-level 
    models. This package is designed to facilitate a principled Bayesian workflow, 
    enabling users to conduct prior predictive checks, model fitting, posterior 
    predictive checks, model comparison, and sensitivity analysis in a coherent and 
    reproducible manner. It supports flexible model specifications via 'brms' and 
    promotes transparency in model development, aligned with the recommendations of 
    modern Bayesian data analysis practices, implementing methods described in 
    Rao and Molina (2015) <doi:10.1002/9781118735855>.
